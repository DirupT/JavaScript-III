/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1.  window binding - In the global scope, 'this' will refer to the window.
* 2.  implicit binding - 'this' refers to the proceeding object before the dot' ..
* 3.  new binding - Creates a constructor that binds the 'this' keyword to the constructor/everything in the constructor.
* 4.  explicit binding - Uses functions like call() and apply() to bind 'this' to the obj that is calling them.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
